It does so by providing ready to use devices that can be placed anywhere in physical space into which designers can plug any required sensors and actuators in order to interface with them directly in their simulations. The toolkit provides an Unreal Engine plugin through which simulation concepts can be prototyped without having to integrate the technologies required to communicate with the chosen sensors and actuators. This enables designers to focus on the simulation and associated interaction, instead of having to develop interfaces with the technology first.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\r\n      \"elaboration\": \"Virtual reality experiences benefit greatly from interactions with physical components. A commonly known example of a simulation that vastly benefits from physical interaction to enhance immersion is the example of racing simulators. These (costly) devices not only sense input from the users (steering) motion, but also provide feedback to the player through rumbles and other actuations. By doing so, simulators are able to enhance otherwise purely virtual environments and drastically improve the immersion of the user. The issue is that developing quality simulators is a costly, complex venture. For an envisioned simulation a lengthy development processes takes place with various stakeholders, making sure to create the best possible simulator for the given game/ simulation concept. This unfortunately comes at the cost of the creative process. It is virtually impossible for designers and developers to easily prototype creative ideas before engaging in the lengthy process of developing a simulator. This makes it difficult to start the development of a new concept as without careful analysis it is easily considered a risky move. This is where Simly comes into play. Simly offers the ability to connect an electronic device directly to Unreal Engine 4 (A common game/simulation engine) in a scalable production-ready manner, allowing developers to instantly send commands and receive data from physical sensors and actuators. By providing this baseline interaction developers can simply have a creative session with basic construction materials and sensors to quickly try out various simulation concepts. They don't have to focus on the implementation of the sensors and actuators, they only have to focus on what they're good at: coding simulations that are fun. They simply pick which types of sensors and actuators they'd want, plug them in, and see if their creative idea is as fun as it was in their heads. \\u003C/p\\u003E\",\r\n      \"gallery\": \"/images/projects/simly/simly-both-versions.jpg,/images/projects/simly/Snowboard-OnSIM.jpg,/images/projects/simly/Technology.jpg,/images/projects/simly/Wheel-OnSIM.jpg\",\r\n      \"views\": 0,\r\n      \"created_at\": \"2021-01-31 08:14:09\",\r\n      \"updated_at\": \"2021-02-04 16:08:55\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"author\": \"Kaz Voeten\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Supporting Social Interaction in VR\",\r\n      \"description\": \"A research project exploring VR Business meetings\",\r\n      \"image\": \"/images/projects/tno/tno.jpg\",\r\n      \"video\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_e1yNdTwo40\",\r\n      \"explanation\": \"\\u003Cp\\u003ESupporting Social Interaction in VR was a research project I performed during the second year of my Masters education at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

As such, we developed an AR game in which you aim to playfully invest into large project in a province to contribute to the circular economy.

The goal of the game is to communicate how instead of funding large-scale initiatives, funding motivated individuals with creative ideas can lead to more noticeable growth. This approach mimics the BOF, which aims to fund creative concepts that work towards improving local communities. Through a transformative practises design approach it becomes clear that there is a lot of strenght within local communities ability tackle social and environmental issues by coming together, often having more noticeable impact for inhabitants than large scale projects that take years. Through small, but organized, investment plans into local concepts by driven inhabitants many communicaties are given the opportunity to collabratively work towards a more sustainable future. This message however is hard to convey to potential stakeholders. In order to better convey this message an AR game is designed that when played offers the ability to invest in large scale (expensive!) projects to grow a municipality. The play is however met with a stalemate in the end, where either funds are abundant but the environment is negatively impacted or where funds are lacking as the chosen initiatives only contributed to the environment and not to the financial resources of the player. This black and white end result sends a clear message that this approach is not ideal and offers little flexibility. It is at this point the player is presented with the BOF, and is able to give away small funds to local initiatives. By doing so, the player sees people coming together and contributing to the invironment. By seeing how communities can come together by just supporting a few driven inhabitants a potential stakeholder can easily understand the general value proposition of the BOFs transformative approach.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\r\n      \"gallery\": \"/images/projects/circular/dfsi.jpg,/images/projects/circular/0.png,/images/projects/circular/1.png,/images/projects/circular/2.png\",\r\n      \"views\": 0,\r\n      \"created_at\": \"2018-07-28 08:14:09\",\r\n      \"updated_at\": \"2021-03-16 11:39:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"author\": \"Kaz Voeten\",\r\n      \"title\": \"TelMee\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Enabling municipalities to hear their inhabitants.\",\r\n      \"image\": \"/images/projects/altena/0.png\",\r\n      \"video\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWUmClVHPps\",\r\n      \"explanation\": \"\\u003Cp\\u003ETelMee is a service that creates an engaged and active community.

The designed system allows you to place tiles in the pavement of populated areas which inhabitants can use to voice their opinion on a local topic. When approaching the tiles, you can notice a statement, and by stepping on the yes or no tile, your opinion is sent directly to a website which monitors the opinions of everyone in your area. Through this website, the municipality can easily add new statements and allow people to voice their opinion through a method that requires next to no effort for the average inhabitant. By placing the tiles in commonly travelled paths, you can still encourage those who do not go out of their way to leave their opinion to wheigh in on a local issue. For those that wish to say more about a topic, the website offers an easily accessible message board for leaving more detailed information on your considerations about the statement.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\r\n      \"gallery\": \"/images/projects/altena/0.png,/images/projects/altena/1.png,/images/projects/altena/2.png,/images/projects/altena/3.png\",\r\n      \"views\": 0,\r\n      \"created_at\": \"2018-02-11 17:11:05\",\r\n      \"updated_at\": \"2021-02-04 16:11:16\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"author\": \"Kaz Voeten\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Construction Time\",\r\n      \"description\": \"An AR Game for young mathematics students.\",\r\n      \"image\": \"/images/projects/finalbachelor/0.png\",\r\n      \"video\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/amCZmxmb9h8\",\r\n      \"explanation\": \"\\u003Cp\\u003EConstruction Time is a motivational game that keep children engaged with mathematical principles at times of frustration caused by hardships in learning at school.\\u003C/p\\u003E\",\r\n      \"elaboration\": \"\\u003Cp\\u003EConstruction Time was created for my Final Bachelor project at the Eindhoven University of Technology. \\u003Cbr/\\u003E\\u003Cbr/\\u003EThis project aimed to provide a fun Augment Reality (AR) Game that would help children, in one way or the other, with their math education. Through exploration of the of strong technological advantage AR offers for creating a feeling of depth and scale of objects not present of the real world and listening to the desires of both teachers and students the general shape of this project continuously changed over time. Children in general expressed a discomfort with learning mathematics, especially during the transition from primary school to high school, and teachers confirmed this specifying the difficulties some students encounter as opposed to other students. The first iteration of the product designed aimed at teaching children more about three-dimensional shape. This was however changed after teachers shed light on some students’ frustration when learning these new concept at a slower pace than others, combined with difficulty proving the effect of the offered teaching alternative. This is when the product changed development direction and became a tool for motivating children who get frustrated (even in class) when working on identifying two dimensional drawings as three dimensional shapes in order to perform calculations. The game offers missions, that the children reported they liked more than just identifying shape, to keep the players engaged in a positive way when they frustration stops them from learning. This while still interacting with concepts related to the mathematical subject they are having trouble with, albeit in a more practical fashion. \\u003C/p\\u003E\",\r\n      \"gallery\": \"/images/projects/finalbachelor/0.png,/images/projects/finalbachelor/1.png,/images/projects/finalbachelor/7-3.jpg\",\r\n      \"views\": 0,\r\n      \"created_at\": \"2017-12-30 08:14:09\",\r\n      \"updated_at\": \"2021-03-05 12:07:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"author\": \"Kaz Voeten\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Horus: An Egyptian Puzzle Game\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Horus is a short first-person puzzle game with unique ambiance.\",\r\n      \"image\": \"https://api.kazvoeten.com/project/image/6-0.jpg\",\r\n      \"video\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPrMLveVTQ0\",\r\n      \"explanation\": \"\\u003Cp\\u003E It is unlike anything I have ever seen.

Of course, you are really excited about this discovery and want to be the first one to enter the pyramid, but once you do, you realise that you are trapped inside.
